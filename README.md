# Random Arduino Projects
Just stuff that I'm playing with using the Arduino GUI.

 - Low Memory NeoPixels : Can I control more then 110 RGB LEDs with an ATTiny85? Lets find out.
 - PS/2 USB mouse: Use a trinket to convert PS/2 protocol to USB and then cheat at fast clicking games, because I think I can.
